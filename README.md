Part A

PROGRAMS
01 Implement Brenhamâ€Ÿs line drawing algorithm for all types of slope

02 Create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point

03 Draw a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformation matrices

04 Draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to experiment
with perspective viewing

05 Clip a lines using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm

06 To draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define suitably
the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the
surfaces of the solid object used in the scene

07 Design, develop and implement recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D
sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user

08 Develop a menu driven program to animate a flag using Bezier Curve algorithm

09 Develop a menu driven program to fill the polygon using scan line algorithm
